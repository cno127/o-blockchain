## üîí **Anti-Gaming Currency Filtering System**

The O Blockchain has a **sophisticated multi-layer system** to ensure stabilization rewards only go to users from stable currencies and never to users from unstable currencies.

---

## üîÑ **Multi-Layer Filtering Process**

### **Layer 1: Currency Stability Detection**
```cpp
std::vector<std::string> GetStableCurrencies() const {
    std::vector<std::string> stable;
    for (const auto& [currency, info] : m_currency_status) {
        if (info.IsStable()) stable.push_back(currency);
    }
    return stable;
}

std::vector<std::string> GetUnstableCurrencies() const {
    std::vector<std::string> unstable;
    for (const auto& [currency, info] : m_currency_status) {
        if (info.IsUnstable()) unstable.push_back(currency);
    }
    return unstable;
}
```

**What it does:**
- ‚úÖ **Identifies stable currencies** - Only currencies with <10% deviation
- ‚úÖ **Identifies unstable currencies** - Currencies with >10% deviation for >1 day
- ‚úÖ **Real-time updates** - Status changes based on current measurements

### **Layer 2: Recipient Selection from Stable Currencies Only**
```cpp
std::vector<CPubKey> SelectRewardRecipients(int count, const std::string& exclude_currency) const {
    std::vector<CPubKey> all_recipients;
    std::vector<std::string> stable = GetStableCurrencies();  // ONLY STABLE CURRENCIES
    
    // Remove the unstable currency that triggered stabilization
    stable.erase(std::remove(stable.begin(), stable.end(), exclude_currency), stable.end());
    
    // Get users ONLY from stable currencies
    for (const auto& currency : stable) {
        auto currency_users = GetUsersByCurrency(currency);
        all_recipients.insert(all_recipients.end(), currency_users.begin(), currency_users.end());
    }
    
    return RandomSample(all_recipients, std::min(count, (int)all_recipients.size()));
}
```

**What it does:**
- ‚úÖ **Only stable currencies** - Recipients selected from stable currency users only
- ‚úÖ **Excludes unstable currency** - Users from the unstable currency are excluded
- ‚úÖ **Random selection** - Fair selection from all stable currency users

### **Layer 3: User Birth Currency Verification**
```cpp
std::vector<CPubKey> GetUsersByCurrency(const std::string& currency) const {
    // This function gets users based on their birth currency
    // Users are categorized by their place of birth currency
    return std::vector<CPubKey>();
}
```

**What it does:**
- ‚úÖ **Birth currency mapping** - Users categorized by their birth currency
- ‚úÖ **Place of birth verification** - Based on government ID verification
- ‚úÖ **Currency-region mapping** - OUSD users from USA, OEUR users from EU, etc.

---

## üìä **Complete Filtering Examples**

### **Example 1: OUSD Becomes Unstable**

**Step 1: Currency Status Detection**
- **OUSD:** UNSTABLE (15% deviation for 2 days)
- **OEUR:** STABLE (5% deviation)
- **OJPY:** STABLE (3% deviation)
- **OCAD:** STABLE (7% deviation)
- **OMXN:** STABLE (4% deviation)

**Step 2: Recipient Selection**
```cpp
// Get stable currencies (excludes OUSD)
std::vector<std::string> stable = {"OEUR", "OJPY", "OCAD", "OMXN", ...};

// Get users from stable currencies only
for (const auto& currency : stable) {
    auto currency_users = GetUsersByCurrency(currency);
    // currency_users contains users born in that currency region
    all_recipients.insert(all_recipients.end(), currency_users.begin(), currency_users.end());
}
```

**Step 3: Final Recipients**
- ‚úÖ **OEUR users** (born in EU countries)
- ‚úÖ **OJPY users** (born in Japan)
- ‚úÖ **OCAD users** (born in Canada)
- ‚úÖ **OMXN users** (born in Mexico)
- ‚ùå **OUSD users** (born in USA) - EXCLUDED

**Result:** 200 recipients from stable currency regions, 0 from unstable OUSD region

### **Example 2: Multiple Currencies Unstable**

**Step 1: Currency Status Detection**
- **OUSD:** UNSTABLE (12% deviation)
- **OMXN:** UNSTABLE (18% deviation)
- **OEUR:** STABLE (6% deviation)
- **OJPY:** STABLE (4% deviation)
- **OCAD:** STABLE (5% deviation)

**Step 2: Recipient Selection**
```cpp
// Get stable currencies (excludes OUSD and OMXN)
std::vector<std::string> stable = {"OEUR", "OJPY", "OCAD", ...};

// Process each unstable currency separately
for (const auto& unstable_currency : {"OUSD", "OMXN"}) {
    auto recipients = SelectRewardRecipients(count, unstable_currency);
    // recipients contains users from stable currencies only
}
```

**Step 3: Final Recipients**
- ‚úÖ **OEUR users** (born in EU countries)
- ‚úÖ **OJPY users** (born in Japan)
- ‚úÖ **OCAD users** (born in Canada)
- ‚ùå **OUSD users** (born in USA) - EXCLUDED
- ‚ùå **OMXN users** (born in Mexico) - EXCLUDED

**Result:** 500 recipients from stable currency regions, 0 from unstable regions

## üõ°Ô∏è **Anti-Gaming Mechanisms**

### **1. Real-Time Currency Status** ‚úÖ
- **Continuous monitoring** - Currency status updated every block
- **Measurement-based** - Based on actual water price and exchange rate data
- **Threshold-based** - Must exceed 10% deviation for >1 day

### **2. Birth Currency Verification** ‚úÖ
- **Government ID** - Users verified with government-issued identification
- **Place of birth** - Birth location determines currency region
- **Immutable mapping** - Birth currency cannot be changed

### **3. Exclusion Logic** ‚úÖ
- **Unstable currency excluded** - Users from unstable currency cannot receive rewards
- **Stable currencies only** - Recipients selected from stable currency users only
- **Random selection** - Prevents manipulation of recipient selection

### **4. Economic Incentive Alignment** ‚úÖ
- **Rewards stability** - Users in stable regions get rewarded
- **Penalizes instability** - Users in unstable regions get no rewards
- **Encourages good behavior** - Incentivizes maintaining currency stability

## üåç **Geographic Distribution Examples**

### **When OUSD is Unstable:**
- **Excluded Regions:** USA (OUSD region)
- **Eligible Regions:** EU (OEUR), Japan (OJPY), Canada (OCAD), Mexico (OMXN), etc.
- **Recipients:** Random selection from all stable regions

### **When OEUR is Unstable:**
- **Excluded Regions:** EU countries (OEUR region)
- **Eligible Regions:** USA (OUSD), Japan (OJPY), Canada (OCAD), Mexico (OMXN), etc.
- **Recipients:** Random selection from all stable regions

### **When OJPY is Unstable:**
- **Excluded Regions:** Japan (OJPY region)
- **Eligible Regions:** USA (OUSD), EU (OEUR), Canada (OCAD), Mexico (OMXN), etc.
- **Recipients:** Random selection from all stable regions
