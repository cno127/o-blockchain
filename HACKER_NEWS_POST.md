Show HN: Can currencies be stable AND unlimited? A new perspective on stablecoins

Hi HN,

Every stablecoin faces the same paradox: you can have stability OR unlimited supply, but not both. USDC is stable because it's backed 1:1 with dollars. Algorithmic stablecoins tried to be unlimited but collapsed (Luna/UST).

What if there's a third way?

The question:
Can a currency be BOTH stable (doesn't inflate) AND unlimited (can print for public goods) at the same time?

Traditional answer: No. That's the fundamental tradeoff.

Our answer: Yes - if you peg to something universal that can't be manipulated: water prices.

Here's how O Blockchain works:

STABILITY (the "stable" part):
‚Ä¢ 1 O = 1 liter of bottled water price in your local currency
‚Ä¢ Users + bots measure water prices globally (think decentralized pricing oracle)
‚Ä¢ If 1L water costs $1.50 in USA ‚Üí 1 OUSD = $1.50
‚Ä¢ If 1L water costs ‚Ç¨1.20 in France ‚Üí 1 OEUR = ‚Ç¨1.20
‚Ä¢ Water prices are stable (everyone needs water, consistent demand)
‚Ä¢ Can't be manipulated (no central authority controls global water prices)

UNLIMITED SUPPLY (the "unlimited" part):
‚Ä¢ We can print O coins for public goods (UBI, climate projects)
‚Ä¢ Doesn't cause inflation because it's CALIBRATED to real water prices
‚Ä¢ If we print more but water still costs $1.50/L ‚Üí 1 OUSD still = $1.50
‚Ä¢ The peg is to REAL PRICES, not to scarcity

The key insight:
Traditional currencies: Value from scarcity (Bitcoin) or backing (USDC)
O Blockchain: Value from CALIBRATION to real-world prices

Think of it like this:
‚Ä¢ Meter stick: Value isn't from scarcity - it's from accurate measurement
‚Ä¢ O Coin: Value isn't from scarcity - it's from accurate calibration to water prices

Why this matters - Three world problems this solves:

1. UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME (economically sustainable)
Problem: Print money for UBI ‚Üí inflation
Solution: O Coin doesn't inflate because it's calibrated to water prices
Result: Everyone gets 420 O/month (‚âà60 meals worth) sustainably

The "Birth Currency" concept (solves migration):
‚Ä¢ You get UBI in your BIRTH country's currency forever
‚Ä¢ Mexican gets 420 OMXN whether in Mexico or USA
‚Ä¢ 420 OMXN = 60 meals in Mexico, only 6 meals in USA
‚Ä¢ Economic incentive to stay home (not walls or laws)
‚Ä¢ Solves migration crisis economically

2. CLIMATE CHANGE FUNDING (unlimited and debt-free)
Problem: Need $6 trillion/year, governments say "can't afford it"
Solution: Print O coins for verified climate projects
Result: Unlimited funding without government debt or inflation

Example: Reforestation project verified ‚Üí receives O coins ‚Üí buys supplies ‚Üí plants trees
No government budget needed. No debt. Just measured results.

3. ECONOMIC EQUALITY (same purchasing power globally)
Problem: $700/month = poverty in USA, rich in Mexico
Solution: Water calibration equalizes purchasing power
Result: 420 O = 60 meals everywhere (basic needs covered globally)

How we built it:

Technical foundation:
‚Ä¢ Built on Bitcoin Core 27.0 (15 years of proven technology)
‚Ä¢ Hybrid PoW/PoB consensus (33% mining, 67% business transactions)
‚Ä¢ 142 separate currencies (OUSD, OEUR, OMXN, etc.)
‚Ä¢ BrightID for Proof of Personhood (one person = one UBI)

Recent milestone (just completed):
‚Ä¢ Migrated from RAM to LevelDB databases
‚Ä¢ Now scales to 8 billion users (all of humanity)
‚Ä¢ 3 specialized databases (users, measurements, business stats)
‚Ä¢ Fixed double-precision serialization (6 decimal places)
‚Ä¢ Dynamic block time (1-10 min based on network activity)
‚Ä¢ 36 tests passing (29 unit + 7 functional)

Current status:
‚úÖ Code complete and tested
‚úÖ Production-ready infrastructure
‚úÖ Comprehensive documentation
‚ö†Ô∏è Need early adopters and community
‚ö†Ô∏è Need measurement network (bootstrapping phase)
‚ö†Ô∏è Need governance framework

Try it yourself:
The code is open source (MIT license). You can:
‚Ä¢ Clone and build it (works on Mac/Linux/Windows)
‚Ä¢ Run the test suite (./test_bitcoin)
‚Ä¢ Start a regtest node (it actually works!)
‚Ä¢ Review the architecture

Links:
‚Ä¢ Code: https://github.com/cno127/o-blockchain
‚Ä¢ Wiki: https://github.com/cno127/o-blockchain/wiki
‚Ä¢ Database architecture: https://github.com/cno127/o-blockchain/wiki/Database-Architecture

Looking for:
‚Ä¢ Technical feedback (did we miss anything in the database design?)
‚Ä¢ Economic critique (is the birth currency concept sound?)
‚Ä¢ Security analysis (Sybil attacks, price manipulation vectors)
‚Ä¢ Early contributors (developers who believe in the mission)

The big question:
If we CAN build stable + unlimited currency through water price calibration, and if we CAN scale to 8 billion users... should we?

I think yes. The world needs this.

Happy to answer questions - technical, economic, or philosophical!
