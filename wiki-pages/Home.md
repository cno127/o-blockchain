## 💡 Key Innovations

### 1. First Water-Based Stablecoin
Traditional stablecoins peg to USD (unstable, centralized). O pegs to water (universal basic need, impossible to manipulate).

### 2. Multi-Currency Native Design
Unlike other cryptos with one token, O has 142 currencies to match real-world economic diversity while maintaining equal value.

### 3. Decentralized Measurement System
Users measure water prices globally, with cryptographic proofs and multiple validators. No central price oracle needed.

### 4. Dynamic Stabilization Mining
Miners earn rewards proportional to currency volatility. More unstable = higher rewards = faster stabilization.

### 5. Unlimited Supply Without Inflation
Can generate infinite O because value is tied to water (constant), not scarcity. Perfect for UBI and climate funding.

## ❓ Quick FAQ

**Q: How is 1 O = 1 liter of water maintained?**  
A: Users measure bottled water prices globally. Stabilization mining adjusts supply to maintain this ratio.

**Q: Why 142 currencies instead of one?**  
A: Matches real-world economics. Different countries have different price levels. Each O currency reflects its national economy.

**Q: How does UBI work?**  
A: Everyone receives 420 O per month in their birth country's currency. Same purchasing power globally because all O currencies equal 1L of water.

**Q: Is this inflationary?**  
A: No. Value is tied to water (constant basic need), not scarcity. Can generate unlimited supply without devaluation.

**Q: How do you prevent Sybil attacks?**  
A: BrightID proof-of-personhood ensures one person = one identity. Decentralized social graph verification.

**Q: What about scalability?**  
A: Layer 1 optimizations (10x block size, 1min blocks) + Layer 2 (Lightning Network) targets 100K+ TPS.
