# Global Measurement Policy for O Blockchain

## 🌍 **Philosophy: Monitor Water Prices EVERYWHERE**

The O Blockchain stablecoin system requires **global water price data** to function correctly, even in regions where cryptocurrency is banned or restricted. This document outlines our comprehensive strategy for collecting measurement data worldwide while respecting local laws and protecting users.

---

## 📊 **Core Principles**

1. **Universal Data Collection:** Water price measurements must be collected from ALL regions, regardless of legal status
2. **User Safety First:** Never expose local users to legal risk in banned regions
3. **Legal Compliance:** Respect local laws while maintaining system integrity
4. **External Measurement:** Use "outside-region" users to safely measure data in restricted areas
5. **Reward Fairness:** Compensate measurers appropriately while respecting transaction restrictions

## 🗺️ **Region Classifications**

### **1. ALLOWED Regions (Full Access)**
- **Countries:** Switzerland, Singapore, UAE, Portugal, Germany, Australia, Canada
- **Strategy:** LOCAL_ONLY measurement (locals preferred)
- **Rewards:** FULL_REWARDS (transaction-based payments)
- **Legal Status:** Crypto-friendly, no restrictions

**Policy:**
- ✅ Local users can submit measurements
- ✅ External users can also submit (but locals preferred)
- ✅ Automated bots can collect data
- ✅ Full transaction rewards to all participants
- ✅ Invitations sent to local users
- ✅ No legal risk

### **2. MONITORED Regions (Compliance Required)**
- **Countries:** USA, UK
- **Strategy:** MIXED measurement (local + external)
- **Rewards:** FULL_REWARDS with KYC compliance
- **Legal Status:** Regulated but allowed with compliance

**Policy:**
- ✅ Local users can participate (with KYC)
- ✅ External users welcome
- ✅ Automated bots can collect data
- ✅ Full transaction rewards (with compliance)
- ✅ Invitations sent to locals and external users
- ⚠️ KYC required for local users
- ✅ Low legal risk with compliance

### **3. BLOCKED Regions (Crypto Banned)**
- **Countries:** China, India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bolivia, Ecuador
- **Strategy:** EXTERNAL_ONLY measurement
- **Rewards:** EXTERNAL_ONLY (no transactions to blocked regions)
- **Legal Status:** Cryptocurrency banned or severely restricted

**Policy:**
- ❌ Local users CANNOT participate (legal protection)
- ✅ External users CAN submit measurements
- ✅ Automated bots can collect data
- ❌ NO transaction rewards to local users
- ✅ Full rewards to external measurers
- ✅ Track unpaid rewards for future claiming
- ❌ NO invitations to local users
- ✅ Invitations sent to external users
- 🚨 High legal risk for locals, low risk for external users

## 🛡️ **How External Measurement Works**

### **What is an "External" User?**
An external user is someone whose home country is **different** from the target measurement region.

**Example:**
- User from Switzerland measuring water prices in China = External User ✅
- User from China measuring water prices in China = Local User ❌ (blocked)

### **Why External Users?**
1. **Legal Safety:** External users (tourists, travelers, researchers) face minimal legal risk
2. **Data Integrity:** Still get accurate, on-the-ground measurements
3. **User Protection:** Locals in banned regions are protected from legal consequences
4. **System Completeness:** Ensures global coverage of water price data

### **Who Can Be External Measurers?**
- 🌍 Travelers visiting blocked regions
- 📊 Researchers studying water markets
- 🏢 Business people with international operations
- 👥 Users from nearby allowed regions
- 🤖 Automated bots scraping public data

## 💰 **Reward Distribution Strategy**

### **FULL_REWARDS (Allowed & Monitored Regions)**
```
Measurement Submitted → Validated → Transaction Created → Coins Sent
```
- Rewards paid immediately as blockchain transactions
- Full amount as specified in reward schedule
- No restrictions or delays

### **EXTERNAL_ONLY (Blocked Regions)**
```
Local User: Measurement → Validated → Reward Tracked (NO transaction) → Future Claim
External User: Measurement → Validated → Transaction Created → Coins Sent ✅
```
- **Local Users:** Rewards are *earned* and *tracked* but NOT paid as transactions
- **External Users:** Receive full transaction rewards immediately
- **Future Claims:** If region becomes allowed, tracked rewards can be claimed

### **Unpaid Reward Tracking**
```cpp
struct UnpaidReward {
    CPubKey user;           // User who earned reward
    string country_code;    // Blocked region where earned
    int64_t amount;         // Amount owed
    string reason;          // "BLOCKED_REGION_TRANSACTION"
    int64_t timestamp;      // When earned
}
```

**Why Track Unpaid Rewards?**
1. **Fairness:** Users still "earned" the reward through valid work
2. **Future Claims:** If legal status changes, rewards can be paid
3. **Reputation:** Can count toward user reputation/standing
4. **Transparency:** Clear accounting of all measurement contributions

## 📋 **Invitation Strategy**

### **Allowed Regions:**
```
Target: 100 measurements
Strategy: Send invites to LOCAL users (prefer natives)
Backup: If not enough locals, add external users
```

### **Monitored Regions:**
```
Target: 100 measurements
Strategy: Send invites to BOTH local (with KYC) and external users
Mix: 70% local, 30% external for diversity
```

### **Blocked Regions:**
```
Target: 100 measurements
Strategy: Send invites ONLY to EXTERNAL users
Selection: Prioritize nearby regions and users with travel history
NO local invites: Protect locals from legal risk
```

---

## 🔒 **Security & Compliance**

### **Legal Risk Mitigation:**
1. **No Local Participation in Blocked Regions:** Locals are automatically excluded from invitations
2. **Clear Warning Messages:** External users are informed they're measuring a restricted region
3. **Optional Participation:** External users can decline invitations to blocked regions
4. **Automated Bot Priority:** Use bots for public data in high-risk regions

### **Transaction Restrictions:**
1. **No Blockchain Transactions to Blocked Regions:** Prevents legal issues
2. **Off-Chain Tracking:** Rewards tracked in separate database
3. **Reputation Credits:** Local users in blocked regions earn reputation (non-monetary)
4. **Future Claiming:** Mechanism for claiming if legal status changes

### **Data Validation:**
1. **External measurements undergo additional validation**
2. **Cross-reference with bot data**
3. **Require photo proof for offline measurements**
4. **Higher validator count for blocked-region data**
