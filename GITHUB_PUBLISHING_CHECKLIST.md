## 🚀 **Publishing Strategy**

### **Strategy A: Public Open Source** (Recommended) ⭐

**Pros:**
- Maximum visibility
- Community contributions
- Transparency builds trust
- Faster development
- Establishes prior art

**Cons:**
- Others could fork/copy
- Need to manage expectations
- Requires community management

**Recommendation:** **DO IT!** The innovation is in the implementation and vision, not secrecy.

### **Strategy B: Private Beta First**

**Pros:**
- Control access
- Polish before public
- Selective testing

**Cons:**
- Less visibility
- Slower growth
- Missed community input

**Recommendation:** Only if you need more polish time.
