## üîß Technical Features

### Currency Metadata Structure
```cpp
struct CurrencyMetadata {
    CurrencyId id;              // Unique identifier
    std::string symbol;         // 3-letter ISO code
    std::string name;           // Full currency name
    uint8_t decimals;           // Decimal places
    bool is_fiat;              // Fiat vs crypto
    std::string issuer_address; // Issuer info
}
```

### Key Functions
- `RegisterCurrency()` - Add new currencies
- `GetCurrency()` - Lookup by ID
- `GetCurrencyId()` - Lookup by symbol
- `IsSupported()` - Check currency support
- `GetAllCurrencies()` - List all currencies

### RPC Commands
