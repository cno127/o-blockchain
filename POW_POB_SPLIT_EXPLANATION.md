# O Blockchain - PoW/PoB Split Explanation

## üéØ **How PoW and PoB Work Together**

**Date:** October 3, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED & ANALYZED**

---

## üìä **Reward Split Configuration**

### **Block Reward Distribution**
```cpp
// O Blockchain uses 2 decimal places (100 cents per O)
static constexpr CAmount BLOCK_REWARD = 5000;      // 50.00 O per block (PoW) - CONSTANT
static constexpr CAmount POB_BLOCK_REWARD = 4000;  // 40.00 O per block (PoB - 80% of PoW) - CONSTANT
```

**Reward Split:**
- **PoW (Proof-of-Work):** 50.00 O per block
- **PoB (Proof-of-Business):** 40.00 O per block
- **PoB Ratio:** 80% of PoW reward (40/50 = 0.8)
- **Total per Block:** 90.00 O (50 + 40)

---

## üîÑ **How the Split Works**

### **1. Block Creation Process**
```
Every Block Contains:
‚îú‚îÄ PoW Miner Reward: 50.00 O (traditional mining)
‚îú‚îÄ PoB Business Reward: 40.00 O (business participation)
‚îî‚îÄ Transaction Fees: Variable (goes to block creator)
```

### **2. PoW Mining (Traditional)**
- **Who:** Any miner with computational power
- **What:** Solves cryptographic puzzles (like Bitcoin)
- **Reward:** 50.00 O per block
- **Difficulty:** Adjusts based on business participation
- **Purpose:** Maintains network security and decentralization

### **3. PoB Mining (Business Participation)**
- **Who:** Qualified business miners
- **What:** Processes real transactions for customers
- **Reward:** 40.00 O per block
- **Qualification:** Must meet business criteria
- **Purpose:** Integrates real-world economic activity

---

## üè¢ **Business Miner Qualification**

### **Qualification Criteria**
```cpp
static constexpr int64_t MIN_BUSINESS_TRANSACTIONS = 100;      // Per qualification period
static constexpr int64_t MIN_BUSINESS_DISTINCT_KEYS = 20;      // Unique recipients required
static constexpr int64_t BUSINESS_QUALIFICATION_PERIOD = 144 * 7;  // 1 week in blocks
static constexpr int64_t MIN_BUSINESS_VOLUME = 1000000;       // Minimum transaction volume (10,000.00 O)
```

**Requirements:**
- ‚úÖ **100+ transactions** in qualification period (1 week)
- ‚úÖ **20+ unique recipients** (prevents self-transactions)
- ‚úÖ **Minimum volume** (10,000.00 O processed)
- ‚úÖ **Active participation** (recent activity required)

### **Business Miner Benefits**
- **Easier Mining:** 10% difficulty reduction for qualified businesses
- **Block Time Influence:** Business participation affects block generation speed
- **Reward Access:** Can earn PoB rewards (40.00 O per block)
- **Network Influence:** Affects overall network difficulty

## ‚ö° **Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment**

### **Business Ratio Calculation**
```cpp
double GetBusinessRatio(int height) const {
    int total_active_miners = 0;
    int qualified_business_miners = 0;
    
    // Count active miners in qualification period
    for (const auto& [pubkey, stats] : m_business_miners) {
        if (height - stats.last_qualification_height <= BUSINESS_QUALIFICATION_PERIOD) {
            total_active_miners++;
            if (IsBusinessMiner(pubkey, height)) {
                qualified_business_miners++;
            }
        }
    }
    
    double ratio = static_cast<double>(qualified_business_miners) / total_active_miners;
    return std::min(ratio, MAX_BUSINESS_RATIO); // Cap at 80%
}
```

### **Difficulty Adjustment Formula**
```cpp
double CalculateDifficultyAdjustment(double business_ratio) const {
    // As business participation increases, difficulty decreases
    // Formula: adjustment = 1.0 - (business_ratio * reduction_factor)
    // This means at 100% business participation, difficulty is reduced by 50%
    double adjustment = 1.0 - (business_ratio * DIFFICULTY_REDUCTION_FACTOR);
    
    // Ensure adjustment stays within reasonable bounds
    adjustment = std::max(0.5, std::min(1.0, adjustment));
    
    return adjustment;
}
```

**Adjustment Logic:**
- **0% Business Participation:** Standard Bitcoin difficulty
- **50% Business Participation:** 25% easier difficulty
- **80% Business Participation:** 40% easier difficulty (maximum)
- **100% Business Participation:** 50% easier difficulty (theoretical max)

## üïê **Block Time Scaling**

### **Dynamic Block Times**
```cpp
int64_t GetTargetBlockTime(int height) const {
    double business_ratio = GetBusinessRatio(height);
    
    // Calculate blocks per hour based on business participation
    // Linear scaling from BASE_BLOCKS_PER_HOUR to MAX_BLOCKS_PER_HOUR
    int blocks_per_hour = BASE_BLOCKS_PER_HOUR + 
                          static_cast<int>(business_ratio * (MAX_BLOCKS_PER_HOUR - BASE_BLOCKS_PER_HOUR));
    
    // Convert to seconds
    int64_t target_time = 3600 / blocks_per_hour;
    
    // Ensure within bounds
    target_time = std::max(TARGET_BLOCK_TIME_MIN, std::min(TARGET_BLOCK_TIME_MAX, target_time));
    
    return target_time;
}
```

**Block Time Configuration:**
```cpp
static constexpr int BASE_BLOCKS_PER_HOUR = 6;     // Bitcoin standard (10 min blocks)
static constexpr int MAX_BLOCKS_PER_HOUR = 30;     // Target at high business participation (2 min blocks)
static constexpr int64_t TARGET_BLOCK_TIME_MIN = 120;  // 2 minutes minimum
static constexpr int64_t TARGET_BLOCK_TIME_MAX = 600;  // 10 minutes maximum
```

**Block Time Scaling:**
- **0% Business Participation:** 10 minutes per block (Bitcoin standard)
- **50% Business Participation:** 6 minutes per block
- **80% Business Participation:** 3.3 minutes per block
- **100% Business Participation:** 2 minutes per block (theoretical max)
